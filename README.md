## Hey there! ✌️

#### I'm Fabian, a 24 year old Application Developer based in Germany.

**I love learning**, a new Programming Language, a new Tool, some intriguing Service, or whatever. If it seems interesting, i want to learn about it.🤓

So far i have only built private Projects or worked on closed source Projects for my employer, but i want to get into open source.🤝

Aside from developing Software, my other 2 focus areas at work are DevOps & training Apprentices.
